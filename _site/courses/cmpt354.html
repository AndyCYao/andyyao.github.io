<h2 id="er-diagrams-and-relational-diagram">ER Diagrams and Relational Diagram</h2>
<p><em>ER Diagrams</em> are for concepts, it is used for abstract grouping of entities and relationships
<em>Relational Diagram</em> is for logical modeling, tends to be drawn when the ER Diagram is already fleshed out.</p>

<h2 id="entity">Entity</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Weak entity are those that depends on a foreign entity to identiy itself. AKA child entity that depends on the parent entity

Strong entity, those that have their own primary key
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="covering-constraint-and-overlap-constraint">Covering Constraint and Overlap Constraint</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Pertains to the ISA relation.
*Covering Constraint* - Does every Employee have to be a contractor, or temp?
*Overlap Constraint* - Can contractor or temp overlap? ie. Can the employee be both
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Super key are set of candidate keys.
- Candidate keys are column or columns that uniquely identifies the entries in an entity
- Primary key is the minimal candidate key. 
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>- This is a physical storage of data, we will be installing relational databases, which is a part of DBMS (database management system)

- The purpose of a DB is to faciliate access/ storing data. key things to note is to protect data from concurrent users, crash recoveries, etc. 

-a schema is a way to describe data
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>- we have DDL, data definition language, which are the CREATE, DROP, DELETE, keywords
- DML, data manipulation language, which includes
keywords such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE etc. 
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="acid">ACID</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Databases must maintain 'ACID'
- Atomic - groups of transaction must all pass or all fail, if fail, a log is used to unroll the changes. 
- Consistent - After each transaction, the DB is in consistent state.
- Isolation - Concurrency control to allow multi user
- Durability - the database must not be corruptible and lose information
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>’'’sql
INSERT INTO tableName(a, b, c, d)
VALUES (1,2,3,4)</p>

<p>CREATE VIEW ViewName 
(SELECT …)</p>

<p>DROP VIEW</p>

<p>LIKE (case insensitive)</p>

<p>UNION - joins two select queries, note fields have to be the same</p>

<p>INTERSECT -</p>

<p>EXCEPT</p>

<p>Relational Algebra’s Set division can be translated to SQL like so</p>

<p>e.g.  Find sailors who’ve reserved all boats
SELECT  S.sname
FROM  Sailors S
WHERE  NOT EXISTS 
            ((SELECT  B.bid
                 FROM  Boats B)
             EXCEPT
             (SELECT  R.bid
               FROM  Reserves R
               WHERE  R.sid=S.sid))</p>

<p>Find Entity that have only 1 attribute
e.g. Find the snames of suppliers who supply only red parts.
Select S.sid from Suppliers S
where ‘Red’ = ALL (select Parts.color 
		from Catalog, Parts
		where Catalog.sid = S.sid and Parts.pid = Catalog.pid )</p>

<p>’’’</p>

<p>a = Any {a,3} 	True
a  = All  {a,3} 	False
a = Any 	{}	False
a = All	{}	True</p>
