<h3 id="er-diagrams-and-relational-diagram">ER Diagrams and Relational Diagram</h3>
<p><em>ER Diagrams</em> are for concepts, it is used for abstract grouping of entities and relationships
<em>Relational Diagram</em> is for logical modeling, tends to be drawn when the ER Diagram is already fleshed out.</p>

<h3 id="entity">Entity</h3>
<p>Weak entity are those that depends on a foreign entity to identiy itself. AKA child entity that depends on the parent entity</p>

<p>Strong entity, those that have their own primary key</p>

<h3 id="covering-constraint-and-overlap-constraint">Covering Constraint and Overlap Constraint</h3>
<p>Pertains to the ISA relation.
<em>Covering Constraint</em> - Does every Employee have to be a contractor, or temp?
<em>Overlap Constraint</em> - Can contractor or temp overlap? ie. Can the employee be both</p>

<h3 id="keys">Keys</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Super key are set of candidate keys.</li>
  <li>Candidate keys are column or columns that uniquely identifies the entries in an entity</li>
  <li>Primary key is the minimal candidate key.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="database">Database</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is a physical storage of data, we will be installing relational databases, which is a part of DBMS (database management system)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of a DB is to faciliate access/ storing data. key things to note is to protect data from concurrent users, crash recoveries, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>-a schema is a way to describe data</p>

<h3 id="sql">SQL</h3>
<ul>
  <li>we have DDL, data definition language, which are the CREATE, DROP, DELETE, keywords</li>
  <li>DML, data manipulation language, which includes
  keywords such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="acid">ACID</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Databases must maintain ‘ACID’</li>
  <li>Atomic - groups of transaction must all pass or all fail, if fail, a log is used to unroll the changes.</li>
  <li>Consistent - After each transaction, the DB is in consistent state.</li>
  <li>Isolation - Concurrency control to allow multi user</li>
  <li>Durability - the database must not be corruptible and lose information</li>
</ul>

<p>’'’sql</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>INSERT INTO tableName(a, b, c, d)
VALUES (1,2,3,4)

CREATE VIEW ViewName 
(SELECT ...)

DROP VIEW

LIKE (case insensitive)

UNION - joins two select queries, note fields have to be the same

INTERSECT - 

EXCEPT
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Relational Algebra’s Set division can be translated to SQL like so</p>

<p>e.g.  Find sailors who’ve reserved all boats</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT  S.sname
FROM  Sailors S
WHERE  NOT EXISTS 
            ((SELECT  B.bid
                 FROM  Boats B)
             EXCEPT
             (SELECT  R.bid
               FROM  Reserves R
               WHERE  R.sid=S.sid))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Find Entity that have only 1 attribute
e.g. Find the snames of suppliers who supply only red parts.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Select S.sid from Suppliers S
where ‘Red’ = ALL (select Parts.color 
		from Catalog, Parts
		where Catalog.sid = S.sid and Parts.pid = Catalog.pid )
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>’’’</p>

<p>a = Any {a,3} 	True</p>

<p>a  = All  {a,3} 	False</p>

<p>a = Any 	{}	False</p>

<p>a = All	{}	True</p>
