<h3 id="what-is-a-graph">What is a graph</h3>
<p>graph is a collection of vertices, V, and edges E.</p>

<h3 id="traversal-terms">Traversal terms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cycle is a closed Path, a Path has no repeat vertices</li>
  <li>Circuit is a closed Trail, a Trail has no repeat edges</li>
  <li>Walk is the most general case, no restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="euler-trail-and-euler-circuits">Euler Trail and Euler Circuits</h3>
<p>if G is a connected graph. G has a <em>Euler circuit</em> if the circuit traverses every edge of the graph exactly once.</p>

<p>it’s a <em>Euler trail</em> if it’s open and traverse every edge once.</p>

<h3 id="theorem----if-gv-e-is-an-undirected-graph-or-multi-graph--then-sum-of-all-the-degrees-of-the-vertices-are-2e">Theorem -  If G=(V, E) is an undirected graph or multi graph , then sum of all the degrees of the vertices are 2|E|</h3>

<p>Proof - 
For each edge [a, b] in graph G, the edge countributes a count of 1 to deg(a) and deg(b) respectively.</p>

<p>consequently, for each edge, it contributes 2 to the sum of total degrees. 
Thus 2|E| accounts for deg(v), for all v in vertices.</p>

<h3 id="regular-graph">Regular Graph</h3>
<p>This is a graph where each vertex shares the <em>same</em> degrees. if deg(v) = k for all vertices v, then the graph is call k-regular.</p>

<h3 id="isomorphic">Isomorphic,</h3>
<p>If two graphs G1, and G2 are isomorphic, then there is a function f that is bijective, and f maps an edge E1 to E2.</p>

<h2 id="graph-proofs">Graph Proofs</h2>

<h3 id="proof-for-all-x---y-walks-in-a-graph-there-exists-a-x--y-path">Proof for all x - y walks in a graph, there exists a x -y path</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define a w to be a minimal walk from x - y, so it is also the shortest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>theres two cases for w . A.) either w has a repeated vertex, or B.) it does not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for case</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A. Since there is a repeated vertex, call v1. this means this walk looks something like this . x - a - b - c -v1 - d -v1 - y. This means we can remove occurences of v1 so that only one v1 remains. This new walk w1 is now a path.</li>
      <li>B. we are done, as by definition it is also a path.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="proof-if-graph-g-has-a-total-number-of-vertices-v-and-total-number-of-edges-e-and-g-is-loop-free-undirected--prove-that-2e--v2---v">Proof if graph G has a total number of vertices v. and total number of edges e. and G is loop free, undirected . prove that 2e &lt;= v^2 - v</h3>
<p>the key is to note that the maximum edges a graph can have is given by the complete graph of vertices v. ie. (v, 2) edges.</p>

<p>then its a matter of rearranging the formula of (v,2) to get v(v-1)/2</p>

<h3 id="general-notes-on-graph-proofs">General notes on graph proofs</h3>
<p>We should remember the property Sum of all degrees = 2 * total edges of a graph.</p>

<p>a k+1 regular graph would also have the properties of a k regular graph. 
	so if k regular graph has a k walk, the k+1 graph would also have it.</p>

<p>in a induction proof, when we have establish a base case, an induction hypothesis, and we are proofing for n+1, it may be sufficient to just draw a graph n abstractly, namely, we dont care about whether its bipartite, complete, or whatever.</p>
