<h3 id="find-unique-solution-to-a-given-recurrence">Find unique solution to a given recurrence</h3>
<p>Given $$ a_{n+1} - 1.5a_n = 0$$</p>

<p>Rearrange equation so $$ a_{n+1} = 1.5a_n$$</p>

<p>then we can see that $$ a_{n+2} = 1.5a_{n+1} = 1.5 * 1.5 * a_{n}$$</p>

<p>so the unique solution is $$ a_{n} = 1.5^n * a_0 $$</p>

<h3 id="solve-a-recurrence-using-characteristic-polynomial">Solve a recurrence using characteristic polynomial</h3>
<p>Given an equation such as $$ a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 3a_{n} \quad a_0 = 1 \quad a_1 = 2 $$</p>

<p>Substitute $$ a_n = cr^n $$</p>

<p>so the equation becomes $$ cr^n = 2cr^{n-1} + 3cr^{n-2} $$</p>

<p>the key part is to divide both sides by $$ cr^{n - lowest exponent} $$</p>

<p>in this case its 2, it becomes $$ r^2 - 2r - 3 = 0 $$</p>

<p>move terms to one side rearrange and find the root $$ (r+1)(r-3) = 0 $$</p>

<p>with r = -1 and r = 3, general equation for second order homogenous solution is $$ a_n=A3^n+B(-1)^n $$</p>

<p>solve for A and B by using initial information $$ a_1 = 1 \quad a_0 = 0 $$</p>

<p>we get 
<script type="math/tex">A = 3/4 \quad B=1/4</script></p>

<p>The solution is thus 
<script type="math/tex">a_n = 3/4*3^n + 1/4*(-1)^{n}</script></p>

<h3 id="table-of-reference-for-particular-solutions-in-recurrence">Table of reference for particular solutions in recurrence</h3>

<p>g(n) of <script type="math/tex">r^n</script> is <script type="math/tex">\quad Ar^n</script></p>

<p>g(n) of <script type="math/tex">n^tr^n</script> is <script type="math/tex">\quad r^n(A_tn^t + A_{t-1}n^{t-1} + A_{t-2}n^{t-2} + ... + A_1n^1 + A_0)</script></p>

<h3 id="solve-a-nonhomogenous-equation">Solve a nonhomogenous equation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Determine the recurrence solution, like 
$$ a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 3^{n-1} $$</li>
  <li>find the general solution for the homogenous portion 
$$ a_n^h = Ar_1^n + Br_2^n $$ where A B are constants that solves the equation.</li>
  <li>Find the particular solution <script type="math/tex">a_n^p</script> using textbook table, note if found to be symmetric with <script type="math/tex">a_n^h</script> you need to introduce a <script type="math/tex">n</script> to break the symmetry. 
$$ a_n^p = C2^n + Dn^23^n $$ where C D are constants to solve for the particular solution</li>
  <li>the solution is now in the form of 
$$ a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = Ar_1^n + Br_2^n + C2^n + Dn^2(3^n) $$</li>
  <li>Use coefficient copmarision to solve for C and D in <script type="math/tex">a_n^p</script> by plugging <script type="math/tex">a_n^p</script> into the recurrence soluation at 1.</li>
  <li>Once we found C, D , we can solve for A, B by setting up 4. <script type="math/tex">a_n</script> with the values from 5.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-a-graph">What is a graph</h3>
<p>graph is a collection of vertices, V, and edges E.</p>

<h3 id="traversal-terms">Traversal terms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cycle is a closed Path, a Path has no repeat vertices</li>
  <li>Circuit is a closed Trail, a Trail has no repeat edges</li>
  <li>Walk is the most general case, no restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="euler-trail-and-euler-circuits">Euler Trail and Euler Circuits</h3>
<p>if G is a connected graph. G has a <em>Euler circuit</em> if the circuit traverses every edge of the graph exactly once.</p>

<p>it’s a <em>Euler trail</em> if it’s open and traverse every edge once.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> be a connected graph or multigraph, G has a Eulerian circuit <em>IFF</em> every vertex of G has even degree.</p>

<p><em>Corollary</em> <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> be a connected graph or multigraph. G has an Eulerian Trail <em>IFF</em> G has exactly two vertices of odd degree.</p>

<h3 id="theorem----if-gv-e-is-an-undirected-graph-or-multi-graph--then-sum-of-all-the-degrees-of-the-vertices-are-2e">Theorem -  If G=(V, E) is an undirected graph or multi graph , then sum of all the degrees of the vertices are 2|E|</h3>

<p>Proof - 
For each edge [a, b] in graph G, the edge countributes a count of 1 to deg(a) and deg(b) respectively.</p>

<p>consequently, for each edge, it contributes 2 to the sum of total degrees. 
Thus 2|E| accounts for deg(v), for all v in vertices.</p>

<h3 id="regular-graph">Regular Graph</h3>
<p>This is a graph where each vertex shares the <em>same</em> degrees. if deg(v) = k for all vertices v, then the graph is call k-regular.</p>

<p>if G is a k-regular graph, then 
<script type="math/tex">|E| = k|V|/2</script></p>
<h3 id="isomorphic">Isomorphic,</h3>
<p>If two graphs G1, and G2 are isomorphic, then there is a function f that is bijective, and f maps an edge E1 to E2.</p>

<p>one can transform G1 into G2 by relabelling the vertice of G1 with the labels of vertices of G2 (AKA preserving adjacencies)</p>

<h4 id="tips-on-identifying-graph-isomorphism">Tips on identifying graph isomorphism</h4>
<ol>
  <li>If you think G and H are isomorphic, then you would need to show there is a bijective mapping between vertices of G and vertices of H that preserves the edge.</li>
  <li>If not isomorphic, you need to show they are different, including:
    <ul>
      <li>number of vertices</li>
      <li>number of edges</li>
      <li>degrees of distribution</li>
      <li>cycles length</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="planar-graphs">Planar Graphs</h3>
<p>Planar graph is a graph that can be drawn without intersecting edges. 
Each planar graph have planar embedding 
which are different variations of planar graph</p>

<h4 id="k_5andk_33-are-the-first-non-planar-graphs"><script type="math/tex">K_5\,and\,K_{3,3}</script> are the first non planar graphs</h4>
<p>Kuratowsk Theorem says a graph is a planar IFF if it does not contain a subgraph of subdivision <script type="math/tex">K_5 \, and \, K_{3,3}</script></p>

<h3 id="hypercube">Hypercube</h3>
<p>two binary sequences of w and w’ have distance 1 if they differ in a single position.</p>

<p>Hypercubes have strings as vertices, and edges if two strings differ by distance 1</p>
<h4 id="distance">Distance</h4>
<p>The distance between two vertices is the <em>shortest path</em> between the two</p>
<h4 id="hamming-distance">Hamming Distance</h4>
<p>two binary sequence w, and w’ of length n, the hamming distance is the number of positions in the string where they are different.</p>
<h2 id="graph-proofs">Graph Proofs</h2>

<h3 id="proof-for-all-x---y-walks-in-a-graph-there-exists-a-x--y-path">Proof for all x - y walks in a graph, there exists a x -y path</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define a w to be a minimal walk from x - y, so it is also the shortest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>theres two cases for w . A.) either w has a repeated vertex, or B.) it does not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for case</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A. Since there is a repeated vertex, call v1. this means this walk looks something like this . x - a - b - c -v1 - d -v1 - y. This means we can remove occurences of v1 so that only one v1 remains. This new walk w1 is now a path.</li>
      <li>B. we are done, as by definition it is also a path.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="proof-if-graph-g-has-a-total-number-of-vertices-v-and-total-number-of-edges-e-and-g-is-loop-free-undirected--prove-that-2e--v2---v">Proof if graph G has a total number of vertices v. and total number of edges e. and G is loop free, undirected . prove that <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
2e <= v^2 - v %]]></script></h3>
<p>the key is to note that the maximum edges a graph can have is given by the complete graph of vertices v. ie. (v, 2) edges.</p>

<p>then its a matter of rearranging the formula of (v,2) to get v(v-1)/2</p>

<h3 id="general-notes-on-graph-proofs">General notes on graph proofs</h3>
<p>We should remember the property Sum of all degrees = 2 * total edges of a graph.</p>

<p>a k+1 regular graph would also have the properties of a k regular graph. 
	so if k regular graph has a k walk, the k+1 graph would also have it.</p>

<p>in a induction proof, when we have establish a base case, an induction hypothesis, and we are proofing for n+1, it may be sufficient to just draw a graph n abstractly, namely, we dont care about whether its bipartite, complete, or whatever.</p>
